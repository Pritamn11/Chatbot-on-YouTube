do you remember this app from your[Music][Laughter][Music]childhood washing powder nma washingpowder[Music]nma it was all over TV in the 80s '90sand 2000s but did you know that todaythis company's founder is worth almost 3billion dollar well the story starts in1945 when kson by Patel was born into afarmer's family in rupor Gujarat at 21he finished his BC in chemicalengineering and started working as a labtechnician this is where things startedgetting very interesting you see duringthe 1960s and '70s Multinational Brandswere selling detergents at very highprices which only the rich could affordmeaning most of the Indians were washingclothes laboriously using Ash soap nutsand whatnot looking at the situation in1969 kenv puts aside 7,000 Rupees toinvent a breakthrough detergent that themasses could afford and he startsexperimenting he starts making sodashand a few other ingredients after a lotof trial and error he finally gets theformula right and decides to producemultiple packet of this detergent buthere is where things took a very darkturn so kenb had a small daughter whosename was nupa whom he lovingly callednirma but unfortunately one of the dayswhen nirma was coming back from schoolshe was hit by a car and lost her lifethis single event changed Carson B'slife forever but not in a way one wouldassume instead of this breaking hisSpirit completely carsen by made it hislife's mission to immortalize hisdaughter he Nam named the detergent thathe formulated nirma and he would go onand make this a global brand he also puta beautiful illustration of a girl inthe white frog on the front of thepacket which was symbolic of her thiswas the beginning of the legendarywashing powder nirma now cenm decided totake his detergent to the market sowhile all the other prominent detergentBrands like Hindustan liver surf wasselling at 13.5 rupees per kg ksen bystarted selling his deterg nma at just3.5 rupees per kg this unique pricepoint of nma detergent immediatelygained the attention of everybody andmade it a local favorite among themiddle class and lower income groupsthis one man was manufacturing packagingand distributing the detergent all froma 10x 10 ft room in his house ksen bywould go around and bicycle every singleday and sell his homemade nma detergentdoor too after work it was after 3 yearsof selling nma on his bicycle when hefinally decided to open a shop inAhmedabad and quit his full-time job asnirma started gaining popularity Kenaiwanted to focus on making it even biggerhe wanted to take a head-to-head fightwith the HS of the[Music]world[Applause][Music]anma so he decided to take nirma to theradios and the TVs to reach the massesnirma collaborated with Pima advertisingagency and came up with a famous Dinglethat we all love to this date it was in1975 when this famous suban nma jinglefirst AED on the radio and continued itsstreak for 33 years in in 1982 the videoversion was aired on TV and in this adthey introduced the four characters HMARea J or sushma these women were arepresentation of nma's Target customerswhich were Housewives the ads the Jinglethe characters and the cultural touchwere all a stroke of Genius I mean weremember this tune from 1982 till todayin 2023 can you think of a modern day adthat has the same recall value I can'tthese small relatable touchesskyrocketed nma's popularity andCustomer Loyalty but 1988 nirma hadcaptured 60% of the detergent market andhad overtaken the mainstream detergentserf just like the jingle claimed nirmahad become suban nirma and kasen'sMission to immortalize his daughter wasalso successful as of today nma is oneof the largest producers of sodash whenit comes to volumes along with this nIrma has also Diversified into manyother Industries like personal careproducts health care products IndustrialProducts education and the cementindustry his story is absolutelyinspirational and here are three keytakeaways that I'd like to share fromhis journey the first one is identifyand address unmet customer needs see Cenby Patel recognized that there was a gapin the detergent market and went tosolve for it he went for the bottom ofthe pyramid the lower income groups fromyour tier 2 and tier three cities inIndia which have historically beenunderserved or overlooked by businessesbecause we feel that there's no money tobe made from this segment or it justdoesn't feel like a cool business so weoften ignore this segment but just likenirma if you can create affordableaccessible and value-driven products andservices you can tap into this vastMarket of 1.2 billion people andgenerate profits while also contributingto Social and economic developmentsecond by making your advertisingculturally relevant your brand canresonate more deeply with consumers andcreate a stronger brand identity andthis is exactly what nma did with HMARea J and sushma nma used small culturalcues and used this to humanize theirbrand and create a stronger emotionalconnect with consumers and lastly thethird point that is relentlessness anddetermination despite facing a personaltragedy ksen by Patel was determined tocreate a lasting Legacy for his daughterhe persisted with his vision startingsmall by manufacturing packaging anddistributing nma detergent all byhimself see successful businesses arenot built overnight every single startupbig or small is a long-term consistencygame that is all for today I Aina Mayasubscribe to sub avv and we keepbringing you more such contentthe IPL is one of the richest Sportsproperties in the worldthe Indian Premier League has just soldits TV Cricket rights for a staggering2.6 billion dollars but you heard itright star India has bagged this hugedeal with 16347 crore rupees[Music]everybody the Indian premiumfor one of the most remarkableachievements in the Indian Sportsindustry but while most of us only knowit as the iconic summertime Sportssensation very few of us know about thebusiness intricacies of IPL that makesit a capitalistic miracle for theeconomy of India and the mostastonishing thing about IPL is that evenduring the pandemic While most of thecompanies were incurring heavy losses in2020 season in spite of the ticket saleshitting rock bottom due to covet inspite of Vivo retracting from its titlesponsorship bcci's revenue from IPLshorter by almost 100 going from 2200crores in 2019 to 4 000 crores in 2020season and today the brand value for IPLstands at an insane Mark of 4.7 billiondollars which is almost 35 900 croresand if you compare the broadcastingrights of IPL at the World level as of2020 while NBA stood at 2.1 milliondollars per match Bundesliga stood at3.9 million dollars per match whereasthe the Indian Premier League stood wayahead at 8.5 million dollars per matchso the question is with so much of moneyflooding into the IPL ecosystem how doesthis ecosystem of Indian Premier Leaguework how do IPL teams make money inspite of losing the competition and mostimportantly as students of business whatare the study materials that can helpyou understand this billion dollarGlobal Sports industry this video isbrought to you by FM but more on this atthe end of the video this is a storythat dates back to 2007 and this yearwas very very special in the history ofIndian cricket why because yurat Singhhad just mesmerized us with six ballsand six sixes movement and the Indiancricket team had just won the T20 WorldCup and the very next year itself the2008 recession happened because of whichbusinesses all across the world startedincurring heavy losses and like we sawin the ABG Shipyard episode the 2008crisis costed the global economy closeto 2 trillion dollars but amidst all ofthis chaos BCC and lalit Modi spottedsome critical market indicators thatmade the market extremely conducive fora domestic cricketing league in Indianumber one because India had won the T20World Cup Indians had fallen in lovewith the new T20 format number two sincethis game lasts only three hours fanscan easily watch the entire game unlikean ODI which lasts for 8 hours or testCricket that goes on for five long daysand lastly during the Summers Indianaudience especially the kid AIDSdesperately needed something forentertainment because they were onsummer vacations and they also observedthat the league games were always a bigbig hit all across the world whicheventually Drew both great revenues anda passionate audience classic examplesof the same being the Premier League inEngland which gave us Manchester Unitedand the NBA championship in the US whichgave rise to some of the richest playsin the world like Shaq and MichaelJordan therefore BCCI wanted to build asimilar product for Indian teams inIndia and this is how ladies andgentlemen the idea of the Indian PremierLeague came to life and little did theyknow that in the next 10 years thisVenture will go on to become one of thebiggest Sensations in sports history sothe question is how does this businessmodel of IPL functionwell let's try to understand theecosystem of IPL very very clearly thefirst set of stakeholders who actuallybring the game to life are organizersand administrators in this case ipl'sorganizers until 2021 was a companycalled IMG or International ManagementGroup and the administrator is still theboard of cricket of control in Indiawhich is known as BCCI then after thesetwo we have the third stakeholder whichare the leaks which in this case is IPLso IPL is practically your BCCI assetthen we have the fourth and the fifthtype of stakeholders who are thefranchise who participate in the leagueand the home stadiums that provide thevenue for these franchise to play thegame these franchise are nothing butyour teams like China Super Kings MumbaiIndians and the rest then thefranchisees rope in the sixth type ofstakeholders who are the players and asyou already know the player selectionprocess happens through an auction nowwhenever these teams play in thestadiums the great Revenue sharedbetween the home team away team and thestadium then we come to the mostinfluential and the most casual stakeholders in the ecosystem who are thestreaming platforms and the broadcastersof the Indian Premier League and thereason why they are so so powerful isbecause they help the leagues and theplayers get directly in contact with thelifeblood of the game who are the fansand the members of the stakeholder groupincludes hot stuff for streaming andSony or set max for broadcasting andfinally we have the most importantstakeholders of IPL who are the fans whowatch the game for entertainment nowbased on the number of fans in thedemography of the fan base we have the10th type of stakeholders which aresponsors and as we all know these arethe companies that actually want toLeverage The viewership of IPL to givevisibility to their product or Servicesnow initially fans are just viewers butas the number of fans and the attachmentwith the game or the franchise increasesthis industry attracts a secondarystakeholder which are merchandise makerthis is where the franchise owners canactually decide whether to license thebrand and take a portion of the sales orto set up an in-house merchandiseDepartment to sell products directly tothe fans apart from that we also havegames like dream 11 that actually usethe game to build a business around thefans of the games I'll get to thebusiness model of dream 11 in theupcoming episode but for now all youneed to know is that these are theprimary and the secondary stakeholdersof the Indian Premier League and thisbrings me to the most important part ofthe episode and that is the economics ofIPL now let's start with the firststakeholder since BCCI is theadministrator of the league pcci usesthe league as an asset and sells mediaand digital rights for the IPL tobroadcasters and streaming platformsthey broadcasters in turn sell ad spacesto Brands which wish to get visibilityfor their products or services so if yousaw during the 10-year period of 2008 to2017 Sony owned the broadcasting lightsto IPL and it bought the broadcastingrights from BCCI for 911 crores per yearthen Sony gave away its ad spaces tosponsors who paid to show ads betweenthe matches these IPL ad spaces commanda huge price and fall somewhere around15 to 18 lakhs for every 10 seconds andthis is where we saw the commercials ofdream 11 Nimbus Pepsi and so on and soforth so Sony's revenue is equal to thenumber of AD slots sold multiplied bythe amount paid per ad slot minus thecost of the broadcasting rights thenonce the expenses are factored in we'llget the profits generated by thebroadcasting partner and similar is theequation of the streaming partner alsoso initially when the league is not atall popular the broadcaster has to takea very big bet and selling the ad slotsin the initial stages is very verydifficult but as the popularity of theleague increases the broadcaster keepson increasing the price of the ad slotsby which these broadcasters andstreaming platforms make an enormousprofit and the value of IPL hasincreased by such an insane rate thatwhen the deal with Sony expired starNetwork paid 3270 crore each year forthe next five years for the exact samebroadcasting rights and this makes it atotal of 16 350 crores that's a crazygrowth of 258 percent now this moneythat is obtained through the sale ofthese rights is then distributed betweenthe franchise and the BCCI earlierfranchise were entitled to a more than50 media rights money but with time thefranchise share has now come down as of2021 BCCI kept 50 of the money while thefranchise distributed the remaining 50among themselves and in this also around45 of the money is distributed equallyamong the teams while the remaining fivepercent is distributed on the basis ofthe team's performance in the seasonthis is the economic relation betweenpcci the franchise the broadcasters thestreaming service and the advertisersand now we come to the individual teampartners this is where we have a companylike aircel that did not air commercialsbut just placed its logo on the ChennaiSuper Kings jersey these are called theindividual team sponsors and thesecompanies do not just pay money toappeal on the jerseys but can also usethe intellectual properties of thefranchisees like the players images orusing the logos of the teams in theiradvertisement now out of the revenuethat the franchise generates allfranchise must pay a 20 cut to BCCI eachyear as a fee this fee is then used toorganize matches pay associations andfor other organizational purposes nowthis individual sponsorship is a veryvery big deal because based on the fanfollowing and the viewership of the teammatches the individual sponsors maychoose to pay more or less to thesefranchise for example if you look at thefan base of all the franchise in the IPLas of 2021 see dsk have emerged as thestrongest franchise with 26.8 millionfans followed by Mumbai Indians at 24.8million fans then by RCB with 13.3million fans these three franchisecombined accounted for 75 percent of thetotal fan base in India while theremaining five teams combined contributeto the balance of 25 so obviouslyaccording to the success of each team inthe tournament and more importantlybased on the fan following of theplayers in the team the brand value ofteams itself varies very very vastlythis is the reason why while CSK and Micommand a brand value of 79.5 millionand 76 million dollars respectively thenot so popular teams like RajasthanRoyals have a brand value of just 34.4million dollars this is how theecosystem of IPL works and as a resultof this capitalistic miracle in 2015alone the Indian Premier Leaguecontributed to 11 500 crores to the GDPof India and this IPL is just a clean ofthe fast going domestic Indian Sportsindustry and in the next 10 years it isexpected that these Indian leagues mightgo on to become some of the mostvaluable leagues in the world and thisbrings me to the most important part ofthe episode and that are the studymaterials to help you dig deeper intothis billion

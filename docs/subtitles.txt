love to this date it was in1975 when this famous suban nma jinglefirst AED on the radio and continued itsstreak for 33 years in in 1982 the videoversion was aired on TV and in this adthey introduced the four characters HMARea J or sushma these women were arepresentation of nma's Target customerswhich were Housewives the ads the Jinglethe characters and the cultural touchwere all a stroke of Genius I mean weremember this tune from 1982 till todayin 2023 can you think of a modern day adthat has the same recall value I can'tthese small relatable touchesskyrocketed nma's popularity

personal careproducts health care products IndustrialProducts education and the cementindustry his story is absolutelyinspirational and here are three keytakeaways that I'd like to share fromhis journey the first one is identifyand address unmet customer needs see Cenby Patel recognized that there was a gapin the detergent market and went tosolve for it he went for the bottom ofthe pyramid the lower income groups fromyour tier 2 and tier three cities inIndia which have historically beenunderserved or overlooked by businessesbecause we feel that there's no money tobe made from this segment or it justdoesn't feel like a cool business so weoften ignore this segment but just likenirma if you can create affordableaccessible and value-driven products andservices you can tap into this vastMarket of 1.2 billion people andgenerate profits while also contributingto Social and economic developmentsecond by making your advertisingculturally relevant your brand canresonate more deeply with consumers andcreate a stronger brand identity andthis is exactly what nma did with HMARea J and sushma nma used small culturalcues and used this to humanize theirbrand and create a stronger emotionalconnect with consumers and lastly thethird point that is relentlessness anddetermination despite facing a personaltragedy ksen by Patel was determined tocreate a lasting Legacy for his daughterhe persisted with his vision startingsmall by manufacturing packaging anddistributing nma detergent all byhimself see successful businesses arenot built overnight every single startupbig or small is a long-term consistencygame that is all for today I Aina Mayasubscribe to sub avv and we keepbringing you more such content
